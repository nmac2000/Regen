```{r}
library(tidyverse)

site <- read.csv("C:/Users/nmac2000/Documents/regen project/Data/site.csv")
overstory_1 <- read.csv("C:/Users/nmac2000/Documents/regen project/Data/Overstory.csv")

```

Now I need to delete all the blank rows. For now, I'm going to leave a blank row if the plot has no overstory
```{r}
overstory <- overstory_1 %>% 
  group_by(Card) %>% 
  mutate(has_nr = any(is.na(TreeNumber)), num_rows = n()) %>% 
  filter(num_rows == 1 | !(has_nr & is.na(TreeNumber))) %>% 
  select(-has_nr, -num_rows)
```

Okay now I need to start doing something with this data. 
Going to make some summaries by plot. 
```{r}
overstory %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarise(count(Species))
  
```
