```{r}
library(tidyverse)

site <- read.csv("C:/Users/nmac2000/Documents/regen project/Data/site.csv")
overstory <- read.csv("C:/Users/nmac2000/Documents/regen project/Data/Overstory.csv")

```

Now I need to delete all the blank rows. For now, I'm going to leave a blank row if the plot has no overstory
```{r}

```
